# LINFO1341-Project1

## Introduction
Here is the first project of the LINFO1341 course : Analyse d’applications réseaux (OneDrive)


## Capture Analyzer
For better manipulation, we made a script using pyshark allowing better packets filtering for this project, as a lot of 'useless' data can be found in our captures.

### Setup
Before using our script, make sure pyshark is successfully installed in your machine : 

``` console
foo@bar:~$ pip install pyshark
```

Once done, you are good to go !

### Options [TODO]
Different options are available : [TODO]
